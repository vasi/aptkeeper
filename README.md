# aptkeeper

Declarative package management for apt. Useful with Ubuntu, Debian, or other related distros.

## Why use this?

It can be hard to remember why I've installed all the packages on my system. This can cause various issues:

* __My system is full of crufty packages that I don't really need__. For example, if I temporarily install some packages to compile something, I'll probably never remove them later.
* __It's easy to accidentally remove important packages__. For example, if I install `apt-listbugs`, that will pull in `ruby`, and mark it as automatically installed. Later if I decide I don't want apt-listbugs, an `apt autoremove` will get rid of ruby, even if I'm using it for lots of other things!
* __It's hard to setup my packages on a new system__. I can't just look at my previous system, cuz I have no idea what all its packages were for.
* __I can't tell what I used to have in the past__. If I was previously developing on some project, I probably installed a bunch of packages, and maybe removed them later. If I want to get back to that project, I doubt I can remember exactly which packages I used.

## How to use this

* Make sure you have some packages installed: `ruby` and `aptitude`.
* Copy `aptkeeper` somewhere in your PATH, for example ~/bin or /usr/local/bin.
* Create a directory ~/.config/aptkeeper to declare your packages
  * Inside that directory, create one or more files with the extension `.keep`.
  * Each file should contain a list of packages you want to keep installed. Comments starting with '#' are allowed, as are blank lines.
  * You can get a reasonable initial list of packages with `aptkeeper candidates`
* Once you think you're satisfied, run `aptkeeper diff`. It will tell you what it thinks needs removing or installing.
  * Then, run `aptkeeper sync` to do the installation or removal! It will take care of installing and removing dependencies.
* Later, when you want to make changes, just edit your .keep files, then run `aptkeeper sync`

## Tips

* Put your aptkeeper directory in git! Then you'll have a history of your changes.
* Use comments to remind yourself why you wanted a package, so you know whether you still need it.
* Need a single package, and too lazy to open your editor? Just run `aptkeeper add REASON PACKAGE`, and it will automatically put it in `tmp.keep` and install it. Then you can organize it properly later, when you have more time.
* Put packages required for a project in a separate .keep file, so you remember that they're related. Now they're easy to remove all at once!
   * Similarly, you can put related packages nearby each other, so they're easy to block-comment and get rid of.
* There's no harm in listing a package twice! Eg: if it's needed for multiple projects, you can list it in multiple .keep files.
* Copy your whole aptkeeper dir to a new system, to setup packages just like on the old one.
* Feel free to install some packages temporarily with apt, without using aptkeeper, as long as it's safe for them to be autoremoved later.

## Detailed usage

### Common commands

#### aptkeeper sync

Install and remove packages to match the 

#### aptkeeper diff

Print the packages that would be installed or removed by a sync

#### aptkeeper add REASON PACKAGE [PACKAGE...]

Adds packages to tmp.keep with a comment, and installs them. Good for small changes when you're too busy to open an editor.

#### aptkeeper candidates

List packages not listed in .keep, and with no dependencies. Good for finding candidates to add to .keep files, especially when starting out.

### Other commands

keepers: List packages in .keep files
missing: List packages to be installed
unneeded: List packages to be removed
install: Install missing packages (but don't remove anything)
remove: Remove unneeded packages (but don't install anything)
update-apt: Unconditionally update apt-mark / debfoster

## Why not use...?

### debfoster

Debfoster is a great tool to find what packages you need. It's got a great command-line interface that prompts you for different packages in turn, and it's much better tested that aptkeeper.

But it has weaknesses:
* Debfoster doesn't support multiple keeper files, or comments. It's easy to forget why you installed something, or which packages were installed for related reasons.
* You can't store your keeper file in git, unless you want to run git as root.
* If a package is no longer installed, debfoster will silently drop it from the keeper list!
* Debfoster doesn't understand that a single system can have packages from multiple architectures, which can confuse its dependency calculations.

### apt-mark

Apt already has a built-in concept of marking packages as "manual" or "automatically" installed. You can use the `apt-mark` command to manipulate this, and `apt autoremove` will cleanup packages that are longer needed.

But:
* apt-mark has no user-visible keeper file at all!
  * You can't put your keepers in git.
  * You can't add comments or split things into multiple files.
* By default, apt assumes that when you install a package, it's desired as a keeper. This makes it too easy to install packages without remembering why.

### pacdef

[pacdef](https://github.com/steven-omaha/pacdef) is a multi-backend declarative package management system. You can manage packages across a variety of different distros and language-specific package managers, like cargo or pip. It supports a hierarchical system of package grouping, where entire groups of packages can be imported or removed from your system.

But:
* There are [serious bugs](https://github.com/steven-omaha/pacdef/issues/90) that make pacdef very difficult to compile.
* It's much more complex than I need.
* It doesn't support certain use cases I like, such as commenting out a whole file when I'm done with a project.

### ansible, chef, puppet

These are great tools to set up systems. But they're designed for production systems that should mostly stay unchanged. End-user systems constantly have packages being installed and removed, and are a better fit for something like aptkeeper.

## Caveats

* aptkeeper hasn't yet been tested with foreign-architecture packages. It probably works, but who knows?
* aptkeeper will overwrite your apt-mark and debfoster keepers. I think of this as a feature, since it makes it easier to use all these tools together. But you might not! Aptkeeper does keep backups in /var/lib/apt/extended_states.bak and /var/lib/debfoster/keepers.bak
* Your .keep files are __not__ a full description of the packages installed on your system. Apt dependencies can be optional, or can have multiple packages that satisfy a given dependency, and there's no way for aptkeeper to understand your intentions. Typically it works, but if you need to have absolutely identical packages on different systems, use a different solution like `dpkg --get-selections`.
* aptkeeper considers "Recommends" dependencies as important enough to keep the dependent package installed. You can change this by setting the apt configuration option APT::AutoRemove::RecommendsImportant.
